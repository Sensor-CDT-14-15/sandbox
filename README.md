This can be used as a test Git repository for everyone in the CDT to learn how to use Git and GitHub.

Gery is so keen on this Git stuff she could almost cry!
She is so happy that James is teaching her to use this, she'll definitely use this for all future projects.

Let's work hard team. Big enthusiastic smile. - Big man Omar
